## 1. Introduction 
This repository contains an analysis done on the AirBnB listings in 2019 in New York City.
Follwing the CRISP-DM approach, I have identified some potential business queries and come up with the corressponding answers. The project gives you an insight about the distribution of properties both in terms of price and in terms of the type of accomodations in different neighbourhood groups in New York City. 
In my project, I will be answering the following questions.
1. **Identifying the hosts with the highest number of listings in the City.**
2. **What are the average listing prices and the distribution of these prices in different neighbourhoods.**
3. **Analysing variations or percentage differences in Room types in different neighborhoods.**
4. **What are the potential hotspots if you are looking to list an AirBnB.**




## 2. Installations 
The following modules have been used in the work done in this Project.
1. **Pandas:** The module is used for data manipulation.
2. **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualizations.
3. **Geopandas and Shapely:** For converting and plotting Geopandas Dataframes

## 3. Files 
The repository consists of a total of 4 Files.
1. This **Readme** file.
2. The Ipython **Notebook NYC_Airbnb_Udacity**. The files contains all the analysis and answers the questions discussed above.
3. The dataset used in the analysis **AB_NYC_2019.csv**
